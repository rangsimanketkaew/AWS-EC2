# Installing NWChem 

NWChem is a quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics software which provides comprehensive many methods such as Hartree-Fock (HF), post-Hartree-Fock (post-HF), Density Functional Theory (DFT), classical molecular dynamics (MD), and hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) for computing the properties of molecule. NWChem is an open-source, fast, efficient, and powerful. The program algorithm is optimized and designed to run with distributed-memory parallel method on Linux cluster across multiple compute nodes.
