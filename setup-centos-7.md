# Setup CentOS 7 on AWS EC2

## Pre-built CentOS 7 image by CentOS team

This is the Official CentOS 7 x86_64 HVM image that has been built with a minimal profile, suitable for use in HVM instance types only. The image contains just enough packages to run within AWS, bring up an SSH Server and allow users to login. Please note that this is the default CentOS-7 image that we recommend everyone uses. It contains packages that are updated at points in time to include critical security updates.
